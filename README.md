# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to utilize Pyber ride-sharing data to gain an understanding of the relationship between the amount of ridership, weekly fares metrics and the type of cities. By using Pandas and Matplotlib, Pyber ride-sharing data can be visualized with graphs which can assist decision-makers at Pyber to improve ride-sharing access and affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
